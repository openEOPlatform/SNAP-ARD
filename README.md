# SNAP-ARD

Prototype workflow to generate S1 ARD data with SNAP using (for now a [fork](https://github.com/clausmichele/pyroSAR) of) [pyroSAR](https://github.com/johntruckenbrodt/pyroSAR/).

The output is reprojected to the [equi7](https://github.com/TUW-GEO/Equi7Grid) projection at 10m sampling on the T1 tiling level.
